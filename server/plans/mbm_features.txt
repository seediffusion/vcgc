if / when condition parameters:
Condition checks can support these parameters.
Unless stated in a condition description, assume the user focus and target range can be controlled.

value/type x: string
Value = a specific card i.e "speed limit" or "flat tire". Type = a group of cards i.e "driving" or "critical hazard".
If value is an empty string, it represents any value. Type must always be specified, can not be empty.

values/types [x]: list
Supports multiple values or types that can be used to meet the condition.
If values is an empty list, it represents any values. Types must always be specified, can not be empty.

user_focus: enum
exclusive, dismiss, include
If dismiss, the condition specifically focuses on targets. If include, it focuses on both user and targets. If exclusive, targets are ignored and it focuses only on the user.

min targets: int
at least this many targets must meet the condition for it to pass.
If set to -1, min = number of targets in the game, and max is ignored.
For example, with min of 3 targets, at least 3 targets must exist and pass the condition.

max targets: int
no more than this many targets must meet the condition for it to pass.
If set to 0, min targets is ignored. If set to -1, max = number of targets in the game.
For example, with max of 3 targets, at least 3 targets must exist and pass the condition. If more than three pass, the condition fails.

players p:
This is a reference to user and / or targets. This means both can be fully customized.

if / when condition condition checks:

int: after players p plays n1 cards of values [x] in the last n2 turns
Note for devs: If each target should have its own usage count, make this condition for the user and for each target separately.
Note for devs: If each card value should have its own usage count, make this condition for each value separately.
if n1 is 0, the condition discourages the player from playing these cards
n2 specifies the turn limit this condition has to be met. Setting to 0 disables the time limit, using the start of the race as the starting turn.
examples:
play 3 "out of gas" or "speed limits" in 1 turn
For the number of targets, it combines their usage count.
if n1 = 3, if one target has played two cards and another target has played 1, the condition should pass.

int: after players p plays n1 cards of types [x] in last n2 turns
Same as values [x] above.
However uses card types instead of individual card values.
Note for devs: If each card type should have its own usage count, make this condition for each type separately.

bool: state of values [x] for players p is active
This equals True if the user/target's vehicle has one or more of the specified values
Active is a bool, True by default
examples:
the user is punctured, the user or 3/5 targets are not flattened

bool: state of types [x] for players p is active
Same as values [x] above.
However uses card types instead of individual card values.

bool: state of all values [x] for players p is active
Same as state of values [x] for players p is active.
However, all of the specified values must match the state. If one or more values do not match the state, this condition fails.

bool: state of all types [x] for players p is active
Same as values [x] above.
However uses card types instead of individual card values.

bool: players p is holding values [x]
This equals True if the user/target is holding one or more of the specified values in their hand.
Holding is a bool, True by default

bool: players p is holding types [x]
Same as values [x] above.
However uses card types instead of individual card values.

bool: players p is holding all values [x]
Same as players p is holding values [x].
However, all of the specified values must match the state. If one or more values do not match the state, this condition fails.

bool: players p is holding all types [x]
Same as values [x] above.
However uses card types instead of individual card values.

if / when condition control:

for n turns
the effect lasts for this many turns

at start of turn bool
If all conditions are met the effect will automatically trigger at the start of turn.

at end of turn bool
If all conditions are met the effect will automatically trigger at the end of turn.

if/ when condition effects:

hand manipulation triggers:
draw n cards
discard n cards
draw n, keep n, and discard the rest
allow playing max of n cards # Doesn't support "at start" and "at end" of turn

speed triggers:
light speed reducer: reduce a milage card by 1/5 or 2/5 its original value.
heavy speed reducer: reduce a milage card by 3/5 or 4/5 its original value.
light speed booster: boost a milage card by 1/5 or 2/5 its original value.
heavy speed booster: boost a milage card by 3/5 or 4/5 its original value.
speed multiplier = n at position n
